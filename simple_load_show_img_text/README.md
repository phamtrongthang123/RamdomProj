# Simple project for quick showing image and text side by side

First extract images and text to images_text folder, like in the example. 

And then start the project:

```
npm run start
```
That's it. 

Server reads plain text from the file so currently json and xml work fine, I did not test other extension but I believe there will be no problem, except they are binary files.

Currently the js in `index(_id).hbs` is a mess so I will refactor when I have time in the future.
